                <p>“Dance has helped me connect with people and brought me some of my closest friends. It has given me the confidence to express myself through movement, while continually pushing me physically to strive for better.”
</p>
                Ursula is a versatile dancer and choreographer specialising in hip hop and open choreography. Originally from Nepal and now based in Scotland, she brings a dynamic and diverse perspective to her work.

              <p>“Dance has allowed me to find myself. As I grow in life, my movement grows with me — and vice versa. It's both discipline and passion.”</p>
              Marco is a Scottish-based dancer originally from the Philippines, with a strong foundation in hip hop and house. His choreographic style blends these roots with afro and freeflow influences, creating movement that is both dynamic and expressive.
              Marco began dancing in 2018, starting with YouTube tutorials before diving deeper into the cultural foundations of street dance. He has since performed in productions such as Three60: World’s Evolution (Glasgow, 2025) and has taught in studios across Scotland.
              Alongside his dance journey, Marco is also a computing student at Glasgow Caledonian University, balancing technical studies with creative expression.

            <div class="member-role">Born and raised in Argentina, Leila grew up surrounded by the rhythms of Jazz and Latin styles.

During that time, she competed in Danzamérica—South America’s biggest dance competition—earning top honors in the “Estilo Libre” category.

Beyond dance, Leila designs costumes for TMRW Crew and created looks for Emerge+See, a hip hop theatre night at Newcastle’s Dance City, produced by Breakin’ Convention in 2022.

That same year, she performed with the vibrant O'Bahia Comparsa at the iconic Carnaval of Gualeguaychú, one of South America’s most celebrated cultural events.

While Reggaeton is her favorite, Leila brings heart and versatility to styles like Waacking, Hip Hop, Commercial, Hustle, and Latin dance.</div>
